<div>
		A game I made with code! The name is called "Protect the Castle". It was for a project for chapter 1 of PLTW. In the game, you shoot the monsters using the spacebar and you lose if they reach your castle.
	<div>
		There are a lot of things in it like images that I have imported and I was able to make them move. Theres also while loops, which helps reduce the amount of code and opens a new set of code ideas.
		<div>
		Also, giving the spacebar a function and the code to kill the monsters was very easy and fun to do. This assignment was almost as fun as the game!
